Your task is to transform the given text into a semantic graph in the form of a list of triples. Each triple must be a list of ONLY strings in the form of [Entity1, Relationship, Entity2]. In your answer, DO NOT include any other comments, explanations or apologies. Enclose each triplet string in single quotes, ensuring NO internal single or double quotes.

When extracting triplets, keep in mind to extract Assertions and Evidence from Text and to Link each assertion node to its supporting evidence where:

Assertion Extraction:
- Identify statements that present facts, claims, or hypotheses. These assertions should be clear and verifiable.
- Use semantic analysis to ensure that the identified assertions are contextually accurate.

Evidence Extraction:
- Locate sentences or phrases that support or refute the identified assertions.
- Ensure that the evidence is directly relevant and clearly linked to the assertion.

Here are some general examples (pay attention to answer structure and format):
